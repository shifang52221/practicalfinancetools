Date: 2026-01-28

Scope: align mortgage topic hub copy to extra payment query intent and strengthen calculator hub CTA text for priority tools.

### URLs upgraded

- /calculators

### Changes applied (high level)

- Updated calculator hub CTA labels to match query language (APR calculator, credit card payoff calculator, mortgage payment calculator).

### QA / validation
- Build: `npm run build` (pass; upstream Vite warning in Astro dependency)
- Local SEO audit: `reports/seo-audit/local-20260128-135229` (issues.csv empty)
