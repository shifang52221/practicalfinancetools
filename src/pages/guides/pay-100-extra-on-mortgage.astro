    <h1>If I pay $100 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If the extra amount is applied as principal-only, it reduces your balance sooner. That usually lowers total interest and can move
      your payoff date earlier. The impact depends on your rate, remaining balance, and how early you start.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Interest is charged on the remaining balance. When you reduce the balance earlier, future interest is lower. Over long terms, a
        small consistent extra can compound into meaningful savings.

      Compare your monthly interest (balance x rate / 12) to $100. If interest is higher, the extra reduces interest sooner.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      After the first extra payment posts, confirm the principal balance dropped by the extra amount. If the servicer marks it as
      "paid ahead" instead, ask how to apply future extras as principal-only.

      If you might sell or refinance within a few years, compare interest saved over that shorter window, not the full term. The

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      A $100 extra works best when it is steady. Consider auto-pay and keep a small buffer so you can avoid stopping the extra after
      short-term expenses.

      A lump sum early often saves more interest than the same total spread out. Compare $100 monthly to a one-time payment using the

      A $100 extra can help you reach the PMI removal threshold sooner. Compare the monthly PMI cost to the interest savings so you know
