    <h1>If I pay $100 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If the extra amount is applied as principal-only, it reduces your balance sooner. That usually lowers total interest and can move
      your payoff date earlier. The impact depends on your rate, remaining balance, and how early you start.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Interest is charged on the remaining balance. When you reduce the balance earlier, future interest is lower. Over long terms, a
        small consistent extra can compound into meaningful savings.
