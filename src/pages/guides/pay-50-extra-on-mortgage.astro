    <h1>If I pay $50 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      A $50 monthly extra principal payment is small, but mortgages are long. If it is applied as principal-only, it reduces the balance
      earlier and can shave off time and interest. The effect depends on your rate and where you are in the amortization schedule.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Interest is based on the remaining balance. Reducing the balance earlier lowers future interest. Over hundreds of payments, a
        small recurring extra can add up.
