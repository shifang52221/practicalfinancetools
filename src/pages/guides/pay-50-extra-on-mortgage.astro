    <h1>If I pay $50 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      A $50 monthly extra principal payment is small, but mortgages are long. If it is applied as principal-only, it reduces the balance
      earlier and can shave off time and interest. The effect depends on your rate and where you are in the amortization schedule.

        <li>Payoff date can move earlier (sometimes by months).</li>

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why a small extra can still help</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Interest is based on the remaining balance. Reducing the balance earlier lowers future interest. Over hundreds of payments, a
        small recurring extra can add up.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Quick way to estimate impact</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Compare your monthly interest (balance x rate / 12) to $50. If interest is much higher, the extra reduces interest early.
      Use the calculator for the payoff date change.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Make the extra sustainable</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      A $50 extra helps most when it happens consistently. If cash flow is tight, set it to auto-pay and revisit after big budget changes
      so you do not have to stop and restart.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Pair with periodic reviews</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Re-check the impact every 6-12 months. If your payment or balance changes, update the calculator so your payoff timeline stays
      realistic.

      A lump sum early can save more interest than the same total spread out monthly. Compare a $50 monthly extra to a one-time payment in
      the <a href="/calculators/additional-principal-payment-calculator">additional principal calculator</a>.

      A small extra can still move you toward the PMI removal threshold. Compare the PMI cost to the interest savings to see which
