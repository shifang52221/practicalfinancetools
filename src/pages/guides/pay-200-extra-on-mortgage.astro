    <h1>If I pay $200 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If the extra amount is applied as principal-only, it reduces your balance sooner. That usually lowers total interest and can move
      your payoff date earlier. The impact depends on your rate, remaining balance, and how early you start.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Earlier principal reduction tends to save more interest because it reduces the balance sooner. A consistent monthly extra can have
      a large impact over time. A one-time lump sum can also help, especially if it happens early in the loan.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Compare your monthly interest (balance x rate / 12) to $200. If interest is higher, the extra reduces interest sooner.
      Use the calculator to see the exact payoff timing.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Example: $320,000 balance at 6.25% with 26 years remaining. A $200 extra can shorten the payoff timeline by years. Run the
      baseline and extra scenarios side by side to see interest saved.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Confirm the posting details</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Check the payment posting date and the principal line on your statement. If the extra is not applied to principal-only, the
      payoff savings will be smaller than expected.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Make the extra sustainable</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      A $200 extra is meaningful, but only if you can keep it consistent. Set a realistic amount you can maintain and review it after
      any major expense changes.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If your loan has PMI, an extra $200 may help you reach the removal threshold sooner. Compare the interest savings to the PMI
      savings to see which benefit comes first.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">If you want a lower required payment</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Extra payments usually shorten the term, not the required payment. If a lower required payment is your goal, ask about a recast
      and compare any fee to the monthly savings.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Track payoff in years and months</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Convert the payoff result into a year-month target so it is easy to compare scenarios. Example: 254 months is 21 years and
      2 months. This makes it clearer whether $200 or $300 extra moves the date enough to matter for you.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Compare to one extra payment per year</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      One extra payment per year is roughly your monthly P&amp;I divided by 12. If that amount is near $200, the savings can be similar.
      Use the calculator to confirm with your actual payment.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Biweekly vs monthly extra</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If you are considering biweekly drafts, run the math both ways. A consistent $200 extra can outperform biweekly schedules when
      the biweekly program adds fees or when the timing does not reduce interest as much as expected.

      Test a scenario where you stop the $200 after one year. This helps you see how much of the benefit depends on staying consistent.
