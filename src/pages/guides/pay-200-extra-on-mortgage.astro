    <h1>If I pay $200 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If the extra amount is applied as principal-only, it reduces your balance sooner. That usually lowers total interest and can move
      your payoff date earlier. The impact depends on your rate, remaining balance, and how early you start.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Earlier principal reduction tends to save more interest because it reduces the balance sooner. A consistent monthly extra can have
      a large impact over time. A one-time lump sum can also help, especially if it happens early in the loan.

      Compare your monthly interest (balance x rate / 12) to $200. If interest is higher, the extra reduces interest sooner.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      A $200 extra is meaningful, but only if you can keep it consistent. Set a realistic amount you can maintain and review it after

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If your loan has PMI, an extra $200 may help you reach the removal threshold sooner. Compare the interest savings to the PMI
      savings to see which benefit comes first.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">If you want a lower required payment</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Extra payments usually shorten the term, not the required payment. If a lower required payment is your goal, ask about a recast
      and compare any fee to the monthly savings.

      One extra payment per year is roughly your monthly P&amp;I divided by 12. If that amount is near $200, the savings can be similar.
