    <h1>Credit card interest calculator payoff</h1>
    <p>
      Many people search for an "interest payoff calculator" because interest feels like it cancels out payments. This happens when the
      balance is high and the payment is near the interest amount. This guide explains the mechanics and what to model.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">The core mechanism</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Interest is proportional to your balance. When the balance is high, interest is high. If your payment is only slightly above the
      interest charge, principal reduction is tiny, so payoff can take years.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">A quick example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Imagine a $5,000 balance at 24% APR. A simplified monthly interest estimate is roughly balance × (APR ÷ 12), which is about $100 in
      the first month. If your payment is $120, only about $20 reduces principal. That’s why the balance can feel “stuck” unless the
      payment is meaningfully above interest.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why your statement interest can look different</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many issuers use daily interest (a daily periodic rate) and compute interest over the statement cycle. Timing matters: purchases,
      payments, and statement dates can change the average balance used for interest. Fees and promo APR changes can also change what you
      see on the statement.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      For planning, the most important thing is consistency: compare scenarios using the same assumptions so you can see which changes
      move the outcome most.
