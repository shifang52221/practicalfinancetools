    <h1>Credit card interest calculator payoff</h1>
    <p>
      Many people search for an "interest payoff calculator" because interest feels like it cancels out payments. This happens when the
      balance is high and the payment is near the interest amount. This guide explains the mechanics and what to model.

      Interest is proportional to your balance. When the balance is high, interest is high. If your payment is only slightly above the
      interest charge, principal reduction is tiny, so payoff can take years.
