    <h1>Calculate mortgage payoff with additional principal payments</h1>
    <p>
      Additional principal payments reduce the loan balance sooner. That usually reduces total interest and can move your payoff date
      earlier. This guide shows a simple workflow to estimate the impact and avoid common lender posting pitfalls.

        Earlier principal reduction tends to save more interest because it reduces the balance sooner. A smaller monthly extra can beat a
        larger lump sum that happens later.

        Common comparisons: $100-$300 extra each month vs one extra payment per year vs a one-time lump sum.
