    <h1>Principal-only extra payment tips</h1>
    <p>
      Extra mortgage payments only help if they're applied the way you expect. The most common pitfall is an extra payment being treated as
      "paid ahead" (covering a future due date) instead of reducing principal today.

        Principal-only means the extra reduces your balance immediately. "Paid ahead" can advance your next due date without reducing
        principal as much as you intended, depending on the servicer.

        <li>Use the servicer option that explicitly says "principal-only".</li>
        <li>Write clear instructions if you mail a check (and keep a copy).</li>
        <li>Review your next statement to confirm the principal balance dropped as expected.</li>

      <li>Principal balance after the payment posted.</li>
      <li>Transaction description (does it indicate principal-only?).</li>
      <li>Next due date and whether the loan shows "paid ahead".</li>

      Some lenders allow you to disable "paid ahead" or choose how extra payments are applied. Ask support if it's not clear in the portal.

      Please apply any amount paid above my regular monthly payment as <strong>principal-only</strong> (not "paid ahead" toward future due
      dates). Please confirm how my extra payment was applied on my next statement.
