    <h1>PMI removal vs extra principal</h1>
    <p>
      PMI (private mortgage insurance) is often required when your down payment is under 20%. If you can remove PMI, the
      monthly savings can be meaningful. Extra principal payments can speed up reaching the LTV threshold, but rules vary
      by loan type and lender.

        If PMI is expensive, reaching a point where it can be removed can create a strong \"return\" on extra principal:
        you save interest and potentially remove PMI.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Example: how PMI can change the math</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If PMI is $180/month, removing it is like reducing your monthly housing cost by $2,160 per year. In some scenarios, paying extra
      principal to reach an eligible LTV threshold sooner can create a meaningful benefit: interest savings plus PMI savings. The exact
      timing depends on your loan type, the lender's removal policy, and whether an appraisal is required.
