    <h1>Biweekly mortgage program fees: is it worth it?</h1>
    <p>
      Many "biweekly programs" are offered by third parties and may charge setup or ongoing fees. Some programs hold payments and post
      them monthly, which can reduce the benefit. This guide shows how to evaluate a program and compare it to a no-fee monthly extra.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        The benefit of biweekly payments is usually interest saved from earlier principal reduction. If a program charges fees, compare
        total fees to interest saved. If fees are similar to savings, it may not be worth it.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Ask whether payments are posted to your loan every two weeks or held and posted monthly. Holding payments can reduce interest
        savings compared to true biweekly posting.

      <li>Model the biweekly approximation in the <a href="/calculators/biweekly-mortgage-payment-calculator">Biweekly Calculator</a>.</li>

      If you can do a monthly principal-only extra without fees, that is often simpler and easier to control.
