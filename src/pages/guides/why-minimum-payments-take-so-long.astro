    <h1>Why minimum payments take so long</h1>
    <p>
      Many people are surprised by how slowly a balance falls with minimum payments. The reason is simple: interest is charged on the
      balance, and minimum payment rules often reduce principal very slowly.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">The key mechanism</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Interest is proportional to your balance. When your balance is high, the interest charge is high. Minimum payments are often set as a
      small percentage of the balance (with a small dollar floor). That means the payment may be only slightly above the interest charge,
      so the balance drops slowly.

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">A simplified example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Suppose you have a $5,000 balance at 24.99% APR. A simplified monthly interest estimate is roughly balance × (APR ÷ 12). Early on,
      interest alone can be around $100/month (your statement may differ due to daily interest and cycle timing). If your minimum payment
      is only a bit higher than that, principal reduction is tiny.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      The payoff curve improves later because the balance is lower, so interest shrinks. But it can take a long time to get there.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Common minimum payment rules (varies by issuer)</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>A percent of balance (for example, 1%–3%)</li>
      <li>Plus interest (some issuers structure it as “% of balance + interest + fees”)</li>
      <li>A minimum dollar floor (for example, $25 or $35)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Your card’s exact rule is on your statement or cardmember agreement. That’s why payoff estimates can differ between calculators.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get out faster (levers you can model)</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Pay more than the minimum:</strong> even +$25–$100/month can cut years off.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop new purchases:</strong> otherwise the balance can stay flat even when you pay every month.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower APR (if possible):</strong> a lower rate reduces interest so more of your payment hits principal.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize high APR balances:</strong> use avalanche/snowball when you have multiple debts.</li>
