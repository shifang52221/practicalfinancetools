    <h1>Why minimum payments take so long</h1>
    <p>
      Many people are surprised by how slowly a balance falls with minimum payments. The reason is simple: interest is charged on the
      balance, and minimum payment rules often reduce principal very slowly.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">The key mechanism</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Interest is proportional to your balance. When your balance is high, the interest charge is high. Minimum payments are often set as a
      small percentage of the balance (with a small dollar floor). That means the payment may be only slightly above the interest charge,
      so the balance drops slowly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">A simplified example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Suppose you have a $5,000 balance at 24.99% APR. A simplified monthly interest estimate is roughly balance * (APR / 12). Early on,
      interest alone can be around $100/month (your statement may differ due to daily interest and cycle timing). If your minimum payment
      is only a bit higher than that, principal reduction is tiny.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      The payoff curve improves later because the balance is lower, so interest shrinks. But it can take a long time to get there.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Worked example (computed)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Using the calculator model: {money0.format(exampleBalance)} at {pct2.format(exampleApr)}% APR with a minimum payment rule of{" "}
      {exampleMinPercent}% of balance (floor {money0.format(exampleMinDollars)}). Minimum payment rules differ by issuer, but the dynamic is
      similar: early payments can be dominated by interest.

      After 60 months in this model, you paid {money0.format(totalPaid60)} total, about {money0.format(totalInterest60)} of which was

      The initial payment needed just to keep the balance from growing is about {money2.format(example.minPaymentToAvoidGrowth)} (interest
      plus a small amount). That explains why minimum payments can feel like "treading water" early on.

      Many statements also include a minimum payment warning that shows how long payoff could take if you only pay the minimum. Use that as

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Why does the minimum payment go down over time?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Many issuers compute the minimum as a percentage of the current balance (with a floor). As the balance drops, the minimum can drop,
      which slows payoff unless you keep paying a fixed amount above the minimum.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Is paying the minimum "bad"?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      It's not inherently bad, but it's usually expensive. The minimum is designed to keep the account current, not to minimize interest or
      pay off quickly.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Will paying the statement balance avoid interest?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Often yes for purchases, due to a grace period, but only if you pay the statement balance by the due date and meet the issuer's
      conditions. Cash advances often accrue interest immediately.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">What payment should I target instead?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      A good practical target is a fixed monthly payment that fits your budget and reliably pays down principal. Use the payoff calculators
      to test a few options (for example, +{money0.format(50)} and +{money0.format(100)}) and choose a sustainable plan.
