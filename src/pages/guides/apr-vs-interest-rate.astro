    <h1>APR vs interest rate</h1>
    <p>
      Interest rate is the rate used to compute interest. APR (annual percentage rate) is a broader cost measure that can include certain
      fees. If you're comparing loans, APR can be useful, but it's not the only thing that matters.

      <li>Interest rate: the percentage used to calculate interest charges.</li>
      <li>APR: a cost comparison metric that can incorporate certain upfront fees.</li>

      Two offers can have the same interest rate but different fees. The one with higher fees usually has a higher APR because the fee
      makes the loan more expensive relative to the money you actually receive.

      <li>Helpful: comparing offers with the same term where fees differ (points, origination, lender fees).</li>
      <li>Less helpful: if you plan to refinance or sell early; your effective cost depends on how long you keep the loan.</li>
      <li>Also compare: cash-to-close, monthly payment, prepayment penalties, and whether fees are financed or paid out of pocket.</li>
