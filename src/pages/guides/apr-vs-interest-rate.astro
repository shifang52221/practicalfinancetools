    <h1>APR vs interest rate</h1>
    <p>
      Interest rate is the rate used to compute interest. APR (annual percentage rate) is a broader cost measure that can include certain
      fees. If you're comparing loans, APR can be useful, but it's not the only thing that matters.

    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Interest rate: the percentage used to calculate interest charges.</li>
      <li>APR: a cost comparison metric that can incorporate certain upfront fees.</li>
      <li>Why APR can be higher: fees reduce the amount you effectively receive, but you still repay the full loan balance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What fees can affect APR (and what usually doesn't)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      APR is intended to help you compare borrowing cost, not to summarize every dollar you might pay. In many US loan disclosures, certain
      finance charges (like some lender fees and points) are folded into APR, but other costs may be excluded.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Often affects APR:</strong> origination fees, discount points, some lender finance charges.</li>
      <li><strong>May not be included:</strong> many third-party costs (for example, some appraisal/title items) and non-finance charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Separate from APR:</strong> taxes, insurance, HOA/condo fees, and escrow are typically not part of APR.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      The practical takeaway: compare APR for fee-heavy offers, but also compare cash-to-close and the monthly payment that fits your
      budget.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      One more nuance: APR is different from APY (annual percentage yield), which is typically used for savings and investments. APR is
      about borrowing cost. If you're comparing products across categories (for example, a mortgage vs a credit card vs a personal loan),
      the way APR is applied can differ in practice, so focus on comparable offers and verify assumptions.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Example: same rate, different fees</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Two offers can have the same interest rate but different fees. The one with higher fees usually has a higher APR because the fee
      makes the loan more expensive relative to the money you actually receive.

    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Helpful: comparing offers with the same term where fees differ (points, origination, lender fees).</li>

      <li>Also compare: cash-to-close, monthly payment, prepayment penalties, and whether fees are financed or paid out of pocket.</li>

      <li><strong>Same term:</strong> compare 36-month vs 36-month, 30-year vs 30-year.</li>
      <li><strong>Same loan type:</strong> fixed vs fixed, ARM vs ARM; watch teaser rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Fees and credits:</strong> list origination fees, points, and lender credits.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash to close:</strong> ensure you can afford upfront costs.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Is APR always higher than the interest rate?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Often yes because fees are annualized into the rate. But with lender credits or certain fee structures, the relationship can differ
      under specific assumptions.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Why can a lower rate have a higher APR?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Because the lower-rate offer may charge higher upfront fees or points. APR helps reveal that trade-off.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Should I compare APR across different loan terms?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Be careful: changing the term changes the payment schedule and total interest in ways APR doesn't fully summarize. Compare offers
      with the same term when possible.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Does APR apply to credit cards the same way?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Credit cards use APR to express the annualized rate, but interest is typically computed using daily balances and a daily periodic
      rate. See the credit card guides for details.
