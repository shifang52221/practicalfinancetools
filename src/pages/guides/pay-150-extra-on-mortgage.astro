    <h1>If I pay $150 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If $150 is applied as principal-only, it reduces the balance sooner and usually lowers total interest. Because interest is front
      loaded early in the loan, starting earlier tends to save more.

      A common way to model "one extra payment per year" is to add about (monthly payment / 12) each month. Depending on your mortgage
      payment, $150/month may be close to that rule-of-thumb.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Quick way to estimate impact</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Start by comparing your monthly interest (balance x rate / 12) to $150. If the interest portion is much higher,
      the extra mostly reduces interest early. Use the calculator for precise payoff timing.

      Example: $300,000 balance at 6.00% with 25 years remaining. A $150 extra can shorten the payoff timeline by months or years.
      Compare baseline vs extra to see the total interest difference.

      If you plan to move or refinance within a few years, compare interest saved over that window. The payoff benefits are smaller
      when you exit early, so test a shorter horizon.

      If $150 feels tight, test $100 and $200 to find a sustainable amount. Consistency usually beats a larger extra you cannot keep up.
