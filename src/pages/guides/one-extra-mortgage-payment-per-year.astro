    <h1>One extra mortgage payment per year</h1>
    <p>
      “One extra payment per year” is a simple rule of thumb for paying down principal faster. It can shorten the payoff
      timeline and reduce total interest, especially when the extra money is applied early.

      <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
        <li>Make a single extra principal payment once per year (e.g., tax refund).</li>
        <li>Add 1/12 of a payment each month (smoother cash flow).</li>

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why earlier usually wins</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Interest is based on your outstanding balance. Reducing the balance sooner reduces future interest, so spreading
        the extra through the year can beat a single late-year payment.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to model it</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Start with your baseline in the <a href="/calculators/mortgage-payment-calculator">Mortgage Payment Calculator</a>.
      Then use the <a href="/calculators/extra-payment-calculator">Extra Payment Mortgage Calculator</a> and compare:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>A monthly extra equal to roughly 1/12 of your payment.</li>
      <li>A one-time principal-only extra once per year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Real results can differ based on the exact day the lender applies the extra payment and how interest is calculated.

      <li>The extra is applied to principal-only (not “paid ahead” toward the next due date).</li>

      <li>Whether recasting is available if you want a lower required payment later.</li>
