    <h1>Biweekly vs extra principal</h1>
    <p>
      True biweekly payments (every two weeks) create 26 half-payments per year, which equals 13 full payments. That can
      reduce interest and shorten payoff time. But some lender "biweekly programs" just hold funds and pay monthly, which
      can reduce the benefit.

      In practice, many people compare biweekly to an equivalent monthly extra. If a full payment is $P, then one extra
      payment per year is about $P/12 per month. Model that monthly extra and compare it to your baseline.

      True biweekly payments can reduce interest slightly more than a monthly extra if payments are posted earlier throughout the year. But
      if a program holds funds and posts monthly, the benefit often looks closer to (or worse than) a simple monthly extra.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">True biweekly vs "biweekly programs" vs semi-monthly</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      It's easy to mix up three different setups:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>True biweekly:</strong> you pay every 14 days. That creates 26 half-payments per year (13 full payments).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Semi-monthly:</strong> you pay twice per month (24 half-payments, or 12 full payments). It may help budgeting but is not the
        same as true biweekly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-party "biweekly program":</strong> you may be drafted every two weeks, but the program might hold funds and remit
        payments monthly. If funds are held, the "earlier interest savings" benefit shrinks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If you're considering a fee-based program, estimate savings first, then compare to fees. A small monthly fee can erase much of the
      benefit, especially on lower-rate mortgages or when the remaining balance is smaller. Use the{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/biweekly-mortgage-payment-calculator">Biweekly Mortgage Payment Calculator</a> and the guide{" "}
      <a href="/guides/biweekly-mortgage-program-fees">Biweekly mortgage program fees</a> to sanity-check.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Also remember that biweekly is not magic: the biggest driver is usually that you pay the equivalent of one extra payment per year. If
      your budget is tight, a smaller monthly extra you can sustain is often better than committing to a schedule that causes overdrafts or
      missed payments.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Finally, the benefit depends on context: higher rates and longer remaining terms typically make extra principal more valuable.
      Conversely, if you're likely to move or refinance soon, compare scenarios over your expected time horizon.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Is biweekly always better than monthly extra principal?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Not always. True biweekly posting can help a bit due to earlier principal reduction, but fees and delayed posting can remove the
      advantage. A monthly principal-only extra is often simpler and more controllable.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Do biweekly programs have fees?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Some do, especially third-party programs. Always compare the program fees to your expected interest savings.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">What is the simplest alternative to biweekly?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Set up a monthly principal-only extra amount (for example, about P/12 for "one extra payment per year") and automate it through your
      servicer if possible.
