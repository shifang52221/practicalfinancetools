    <h1>What counts in debt-to-income (DTI)</h1>
    <p>
      DTI is usually based on required monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income. This guide summarizes what typically
      counts, how minimum payments are treated, and how to document the assumptions you used.

      <li>Subscriptions and utilities usually do not count as debt.</li>

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">How minimum payments are treated</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Most lenders use the minimum required payment on credit cards, not your planned payoff amount. If you pay more than the minimum,
        the DTI ratio will still be based on the required minimum unless the lender uses a different rule.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Gross vs net income</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        DTI is typically based on gross income before taxes. Using net income will make the ratio look worse, so keep the definition
        consistent when comparing scenarios.

      <li>Principal and interest from the loan amount and rate.</li>

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Example: gross income is $6,000/month. Required debt payments are $1,900/month (housing $1,400 + auto $300 + card minimums $200).
      DTI = $1,900 / $6,000 = 31.7%. Keep the inputs consistent when comparing offers.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Student loans and deferred balances</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many programs use the payment shown on your credit report, but some use an assumed payment if the loan is deferred or shows a
      zero payment. Check the lender rule before excluding the loan from DTI.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Typical DTI band checks</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many lenders evaluate whether your DTI is within a target band for the loan program. The exact thresholds vary, but lower ratios
      generally offer more flexibility. Use your own lender's guidance rather than a generic target.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Lower DTI usually means easier approval and more pricing options.</li>
      <li>Borderline DTI often requires stronger credit or more documentation.</li>
      <li>Higher DTI can still be approved, but rules are stricter and vary by program.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Front-end vs back-end DTI</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Some lenders look at a housing-only ratio (front-end) and a total-debt ratio (back-end). Front-end is usually housing costs divided
      by gross income, while back-end includes all required debt payments. Ask which ratio is being used.

      Only if they are part of a required monthly payment arrangement. Otherwise, they are not typically included in DTI.
