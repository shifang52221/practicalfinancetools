    <h1>APR tool</h1>
    <p>
      Use this APR tool to estimate the cost of a loan when fees are involved, and compare offers under consistent assumptions. This is an
      educational estimate, not an official lender disclosure.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What to enter</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Loan amount</li>
      <li>Interest rate</li>
      <li>Term</li>
      <li>Upfront fees (origination, points)</li>

    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Tip: keep assumptions consistent across offers. If one lender quotes a different term or includes taxes/insurance in a “payment”
      figure, normalize inputs so you’re comparing like with like.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What APR is doing (plain English)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Fees can make a loan more expensive even if the interest rate is the same. APR tries to express that cost as an annualized rate by
      accounting for money you pay upfront (fees/points) relative to the cash you actually receive.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      Because fees are often “front-loaded,” APR is most useful when you expect to keep the loan for a meaningful portion of the term.
      If you will refinance or move quickly, a break-even approach can be more informative than a single APR number.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Example: compare two offers</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Offer A: $20,000, 7.99% for 5 years, $0 fees. Offer B: $20,000, 7.49% for 5 years, $800 origination fee. Payments may look close,
      but Offer B could be more or less expensive depending on the fee size and the rate difference. Use the APR calculator to estimate
      which offer is cheaper under the same term and compare total dollars paid over your likely time horizon.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to use results</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR helps compare offers with different fees.</li>
      <li>Also compare cash-to-close and total dollars paid over your likely time horizon.</li>
      <li>If you refinance early, APR may not be the best single metric.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="margin:16px 0 8px">Common pitfalls</h3>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Comparing different terms (a 3-year vs 5-year loan) without realizing the trade-off.</li>
      <li>Ignoring fees that are paid out-of-pocket versus rolled into the balance.</li>
      <li>Comparing APR but not comparing the dollar cost over the time you’ll actually keep the loan.</li>
