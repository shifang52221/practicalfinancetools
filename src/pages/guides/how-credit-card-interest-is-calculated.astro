    <h1>How credit card interest is calculated</h1>
    <p>
      Credit card interest is often based on a daily rate applied to your daily balance, then shown on your monthly statement. This guide
      explains the mechanics and how to get useful payoff estimates with a calculator.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">APR vs daily periodic rate</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        APR is an annualized rate. Many issuers convert it to a daily periodic rate (DPR) and apply it to your daily balance. The
        statement interest charge depends on your daily balances and statement cycle length.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why your statement can differ</h2>
      <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
        <li>Interest accrues daily, not just monthly.</li>
        <li>Statement cycle dates vary month to month.</li>
        <li>New purchases, fees, and balance transfers change the balance.</li>
        <li>Grace periods and promotional APRs can change interest behavior.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How issuers usually compute interest (typical)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many US credit cards use some version of an <strong>average daily balance</strong> method: the issuer looks at your balance each day
      of the billing cycle, applies a daily rate, and totals the interest for the statement period. The exact method can vary by issuer
      and product, so your statement and cardmember agreement are the source of truth.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Daily periodic rate (DPR):</strong> often approximated as APR / 365 (or / 360 in some cases).</li>
      <li><strong>Daily interest:</strong> daily balance * DPR.</li>
      <li><strong>Statement interest:</strong> sum of daily interest across the cycle (plus any fees/interest rules).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      This daily approach is one reason a simple monthly estimate won't match your statement to the penny, especially when you make
      payments mid-cycle or add purchases throughout the month.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Grace period: why you might pay $0 interest</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many credit cards offer a grace period on purchases: if you pay the statement balance in full by the due date, purchases may not
      accrue interest. But carrying a balance can remove the grace period, and certain transactions (cash advances are a common example)
      may accrue interest immediately.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If you recently carried a balance and then paid in full, you may see a small "trailing" interest charge on the next statement. That's
      interest accrued between the statement close date and the date your payment posted.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How payoff calculators estimate interest</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      For planning, many calculators estimate interest monthly as balance * (APR / 12). That makes it easy to compare "what if" scenarios
      consistently, even though it may not match your statement to the penny.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If your goal is to reduce total interest, the big levers are payment size, stopping new purchases, and lowering APR (when possible).

      Your statement interest will differ because of daily interest and cycle timing, but the direction is reliable: larger payments reduce
      total interest by shrinking the balance faster.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Do I pay interest if I pay the statement balance in full?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Often no, because many cards offer a grace period on purchases when you pay your statement balance by the due date. But cash advances
      and some fees can accrue interest immediately, and promotional terms vary.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">What is "trailing interest"?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Trailing interest (also called residual interest) is interest that accrues between the statement close date and the date your payment
      is received. Even if you pay in full after carrying a balance, you might see a small interest charge on the next statement.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Why doesn't my statement match a payoff calculator?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Statements often use daily balances and the exact cycle length, while many payoff calculators use consistent monthly estimates to
      compare scenarios. A calculator is best for planning and comparing options.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Is my APR fixed?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Many cards have variable APRs that move with an index rate (often the Prime Rate) plus a margin. Your terms and statements describe
      when and how APR can change.
