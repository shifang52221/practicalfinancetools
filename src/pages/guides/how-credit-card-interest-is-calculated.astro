    <h1>How credit card interest is calculated</h1>
    <p>
      Credit card interest is often based on a daily rate applied to your daily balance, then shown on your monthly statement. This guide
      explains the mechanics and how to get useful payoff estimates with a calculator.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        APR is an annualized rate. Many issuers convert it to a daily periodic rate (DPR) and apply it to your daily balance. The
        statement interest charge depends on your daily balances and statement cycle length.

        <li>Interest accrues daily, not just monthly.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How payoff calculators estimate interest</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      For planning, many calculators estimate interest monthly as balance × (APR ÷ 12). That makes it easy to compare "what if" scenarios
      consistently, even though it may not match your statement to the penny.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If your goal is to reduce total interest, the big levers are payment size, stopping new purchases, and lowering APR (when possible).

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What to check on your statement</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Purchase APR (and any cash advance / balance transfer APR).</li>
      <li>Interest calculation method (average daily balance is common).</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rule (it varies by issuer).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If you want statement-accurate projections, use statement cycle dates and issuer rules. For most payoff decisions, consistent
      comparisons are more important than exact pennies.
