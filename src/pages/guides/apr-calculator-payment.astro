    <h1>APR calculator payment</h1>
    <p>
      Your monthly payment is primarily driven by the interest rate and term. APR is an annualized cost metric that can incorporate
      certain fees, and it can be higher than the interest rate even if the payment doesn't look dramatically different.

        Two offers can have similar payments but different upfront fees. Fees can raise APR because they reduce the net amount you
        effectively receive while you still repay the full balance.
