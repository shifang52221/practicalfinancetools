    <h1>APR calculator payment</h1>
    <p>
      Your monthly payment is primarily driven by the interest rate and term. APR is an annualized cost metric that can incorporate
      certain fees, and it can be higher than the interest rate even if the payment doesn't look dramatically different.

      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Two offers can have similar payments but different upfront fees. Fees can raise APR because they reduce the net amount you
        effectively receive while you still repay the full balance.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to compare offers</h2>

        <li>Keep term constant when comparing.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Payment: what actually drives it</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      For a standard fixed-rate loan, the monthly principal-and-interest payment is driven by (1) the interest rate, (2) the term, and
      (3) the amount financed. Upfront fees often don't change the advertised interest rate, but they do change your effective borrowing
      cost.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      This is why two offers can have similar payments but different APR: the payment is about the loan math, while APR is trying to
      express the "rate-equivalent" cost of fees over time.
    </p>

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Example: {money0.format(exampleLoan)} for {exampleTerm} months at {pct2.format(exampleRate)}%. Both offers have the same nominal rate,
      but one includes a fee. The payment is similar, while APR increases to account for the fee.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What to do when you might repay early</h2>

      If you expect to refinance, sell, or repay early, compare offers using a time-horizon view: total dollars paid (payments + fees)
      over the number of months you realistically expect to keep the loan. A higher-fee "lower rate" offer may need time to break even.

      For mortgages, you can pair the APR calculator with payment and amortization comparisons to see both monthly cash flow and total
      interest.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Why is my payment similar but APR different?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Payments are driven by rate, term, and amount financed. APR reflects fees, so it can rise without a large payment change.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Should I focus on APR or payment?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Both. Payment affects monthly cash flow, while APR helps compare total cost when fees differ.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Does APR include every fee?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Not always. Use the lender disclosure to verify which fees are included and model any others separately.
