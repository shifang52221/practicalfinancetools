    <h1>APR calculator payment</h1>
    <p>
      Your monthly payment is primarily driven by the interest rate and term. APR is an annualized cost metric that can incorporate
      certain fees, and it can be higher than the interest rate even if the payment doesn't look dramatically different.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why payment and APR can diverge</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
        Two offers can have similar payments but different upfront fees. Fees can raise APR because they reduce the net amount you
        effectively receive while you still repay the full balance.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to compare offers</h2>
      <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
        <li>Keep term constant when comparing.</li>
        <li>Compare APR and also total dollars paid over your time horizon.</li>
        <li>Consider whether you'll refinance or repay early.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Payment: what actually drives it</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      For a standard fixed-rate loan, the monthly principal-and-interest payment is driven by (1) the interest rate, (2) the term, and
      (3) the amount financed. Upfront fees often don’t change the advertised interest rate, but they do change your effective borrowing
      cost.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      This is why two offers can have similar payments but different APR: the payment is about the loan math, while APR is trying to
      express the “rate-equivalent” cost of fees over time.
    </p>

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Example: same payment, different APR</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Imagine two offers with the same rate and term, but one includes an origination fee. The monthly payment might look identical
      because it is based on the financed amount and rate, yet the fee reduces the net amount you receive (or increases the cash you must
      bring). APR increases to reflect that extra cost.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>If you pay the fee out-of-pocket, you receive less net value for the same payment stream.</li>
      <li>If you roll the fee into the loan, the payment may rise slightly because the financed balance is higher.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card section prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What to do when you might repay early</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If you expect to refinance, sell, or repay early, compare offers using a time-horizon view: total dollars paid (payments + fees)
      over the number of months you realistically expect to keep the loan. A higher-fee “lower rate” offer may need time to break even.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      For mortgages, you can pair the APR calculator with payment and amortization comparisons to see both monthly cash flow and total
      interest.
