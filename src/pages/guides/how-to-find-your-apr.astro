    <h1>How to find out your APR</h1>
    <p>
      APR is a standardized way to express borrowing cost. For credit cards it usually appears on your statement and account terms. For
      loans it appears in lender disclosures. This guide shows where to look and how to use APR in comparisons.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many people search for "my APR" and find multiple APRs. On a US credit card, the APR depends on the balance type and sometimes your
      account status.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Purchase APR:</strong> the main APR for purchases that accrue interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance transfer APR:</strong> may differ from purchase APR and may have a promo period.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash advance APR:</strong> often higher; interest can start immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalty APR:</strong> may apply after late payments or other triggers (rules vary).</li>
      <li><strong>Intro / promotional APR:</strong> temporary rate; note the end date and conditions.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Variable APR: why it can change</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Many credit cards list APR as "Prime + margin" (or another index + margin). When the index changes, your APR can change too. Your
      statement and cardmember agreement explain when changes take effect.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Quick walkthrough: finding APR on a statement</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      If you're looking at a monthly credit card statement, start by finding the section that lists rates and fees. It typically shows the
      purchase APR and may also list cash advance and balance transfer APRs.
    </p>
    <ol class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Locate the "Interest Charges" or "Rates and Fees" section.</li>
      <li>Identify the APR that matches your balance type (purchase vs transfer vs cash advance).</li>
      <li>Check whether the APR is variable and what index it tracks.</li>
      <li>Confirm the billing cycle dates (APR is annual; interest may be computed using daily balances).</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      If you want to model payoff, use the purchase APR that applies to your revolving balance and run a few fixed-payment scenarios in the{" "}

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What APR means (in plain language)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      The interest rate is the nominal rate used to compute interest. APR can include certain upfront fees and timing assumptions, so it
      can be higher than the interest rate even when the monthly payment looks similar.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      APR is useful for comparisons when you hold assumptions constant (term, payment schedule, and which fees are included).

      <li>Compare offers with the same term (e.g., 36 months vs 36 months).</li>

      <li>Use the <a href="/calculators/apr-calculator">APR calculator</a> to estimate APR under consistent assumptions.</li>
      <li>Also compare total dollars paid over your likely time horizon (APR can mislead if you refinance or repay early).</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Where is APR on a mortgage?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      In the US, APR is shown prominently on mortgage disclosures like the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. Your lender or broker can
      point you to the exact line if you ask.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Why do I see multiple APRs on my credit card?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      Different APRs can apply to purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, and penalty situations. Your statement typically lists each
      APR separately.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin:12px 0 0">Should I compare APR or interest rate?</h3>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0">
      For loans with fees, APR is often the better apples-to-apples metric, but you should still compare the payment, cash needed at
      closing, and your time horizon.
