    <h1>How to find out your APR</h1>
    <p>
      APR is a standardized way to express borrowing cost. For credit cards it usually appears on your statement and account terms. For
      loans it appears in lender disclosures. This guide shows where to look and how to use APR in comparisons.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What APR means (in plain language)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      The interest rate is the nominal rate used to compute interest. APR can include certain upfront fees and timing assumptions, so it
      can be higher than the interest rate even when the monthly payment looks similar.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:12px 0 0">
      APR is useful for comparisons when you hold assumptions constant (term, payment schedule, and which fees are included).

    <ol class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Compare offers with the same term (e.g., 36 months vs 36 months).</li>
      <li>Note upfront fees (origination fees, points) and whether they are paid upfront or financed.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="/calculators/apr-calculator">APR calculator</a> to estimate APR under consistent assumptions.</li>
      <li>Also compare total dollars paid over your likely time horizon (APR can mislead if you refinance or repay early).</li>
