    <h1>If I pay $300 extra on my mortgage, what happens?</h1>
    <p>
      If the extra amount is applied as principal-only, you reduce the loan balance sooner. That usually reduces total interest and can
      shorten your payoff timeline. This guide explains the mechanics and what to check so the payment is applied the way you expect.

    <p class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0">
      Earlier payments tend to save more interest because they reduce the balance sooner. That’s why a recurring monthly extra can have a
      large impact over time. A one-time lump sum can also help, especially if it happens early in the loan.
