    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Compare a baseline payment to adding an extra $100–$300 per month. Even small extra payments can reduce payoff
      time because they go directly to principal.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Extra payments typically reduce payoff time, not the required monthly payment (unless you recast).</li>
      <li>Some lenders have rules for how extra payments are applied—confirm “principal-only” application.</li>
      <li>If your loan has a prepayment penalty, the savings may be reduced.</li>
      <li>Escrow items (tax/insurance) are separate from principal and interest—extra payments don’t reduce escrow.</li>
    </ul>
