  intro="See how paying extra toward principal (monthly extra, one-time lump sum, or additional principal payments) can shorten your mortgage payoff timeline and reduce total interest. Educational use only. Not financial advice."
  how={[
    "Baseline schedule uses standard amortization for principal & interest.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "If I pay $300 extra on my mortgage, what happens?",
      a: "An extra $300 typically goes to principal (if applied as principal-only), which reduces the balance sooner and can shorten payoff time and total interest. Compare a $300 monthly extra vs a one-time payment to see the difference."
    },
    {
      q: "Additional principal payment mortgage calculator: what inputs do I need?",
      a: "Start with loan amount, interest rate, and term, then add an extra principal amount (monthly or lump sum). This calculator compares the baseline vs extra-payment payoff date and total interest under the same assumptions."
    },
    {
      q: "One extra mortgage payment per year: how do I model that?",
      a: "A common approximation is to add 1/12 of a payment each month, or make one larger principal-only payment once per year. Earlier payments usually save more interest."
    },
    {
      q: "Mortgage calculator with extra payments and lump sum: does this support lump sums?",
      a: "Use the extra payment amount to model a one-time additional principal payment (lump sum) and compare it to ongoing monthly extras. Exact lender posting dates can change results."
    },
    {
      q: "Does an extra payment reduce my required monthly payment?",
      a: "Usually no. It reduces your balance and payoff time; the required payment typically stays the same unless you recast the loan."
    },
    {
      q: "Monthly vs one-time extra: which is better?",
      a: "Earlier payments generally save more interest because they reduce the balance sooner. Compare scenarios to see the impact."
    },
    {
      q: "What about prepayment penalties?",
      a: "Some loans have them. This calculator assumes none; check your loan terms."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I invest instead?",
      a: "This tool doesn't give advice. Compare your mortgage rate to expected after-tax investment returns and your risk tolerance."
    },
    {
      q: "Is rounding handled exactly like my lender?",
      a: "Not necessarily. Results are estimates and real statements can differ due to rounding and timing."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Compare a baseline payment to adding an extra $100-$300 per month. Even small extra payments can reduce payoff
      time because they go directly to principal.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Extra payments typically reduce payoff time, not the required monthly payment (unless you recast).</li>
      <li>Some lenders have rules for how extra payments are applied; confirm "principal-only" application.</li>
      <li>If your loan has a prepayment penalty, the savings may be reduced.</li>
      <li>Escrow items (tax/insurance) are separate from principal and interest; extra payments don't reduce escrow.</li>
    </ul>
