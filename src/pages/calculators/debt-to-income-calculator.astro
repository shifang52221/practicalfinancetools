      q: "What counts as monthly debt?",
      a: "Typically required payments like mortgage/rent, auto loans, student loans, and minimum credit card payments. Some lenders also include other obligations depending on policy."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I use gross or net income?",
      a: "Most DTI calculations use gross income (before taxes). Some affordability checks use net income separately."
    },
    {
      q: "What is a good DTI?",
      a: "Many programs use thresholds around 36%–43% for back-end DTI, but it varies by lender, program, and compensating factors."
    },
    {
      q: "Is rent included?",
      a: "Rent is often treated as housing cost in affordability checks. Mortgage underwriting uses the projected housing payment for the loan."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include property taxes and insurance?",
      a: "If you include them in the housing payment input, yes. For mortgages, lenders often use PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) and may add HOA and PMI."
    },
    {
      q: "Will DTI alone determine approval?",
      a: "No. Credit score, assets, employment, reserves, and underwriting guidelines also matter."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Suppose your gross income is $8,000/month. If your total housing payment is $2,400 and other monthly debts are
      $600, your front-end DTI is 30% and your back-end DTI is 37.5%.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>DTI usually uses gross income, not take-home pay.</li>
      <li>For mortgages, lenders often use PITI (+ HOA/PMI), not just principal and interest.</li>
      <li>Some debts may be excluded or treated differently depending on lender and program.</li>
      <li>DTI is only one factor—credit, reserves, and underwriting guidelines still apply.</li>
    </ul>
