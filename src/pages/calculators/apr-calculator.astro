  faqs={[
    {
      q: "APR vs interest rate: what’s the difference?",
      a: "Interest rate is the nominal rate used to compute interest. APR includes certain fees and can be higher than the interest rate."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I calculate APR with an origination fee?",
      a: "Treat the origination fee as reducing the amount you effectively receive. APR is the rate that makes the present value of your payments equal to (loan amount - fees)."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I calculate APR from a monthly payment?",
      a: "Sometimes. If you know the loan amount, term, and fees, the payment can imply an APR. This calculator estimates APR under a simplified schedule; real disclosures can differ."
    },
    {
      q: "Which fees should I include?",
      a: "Include upfront fees that reduce what you effectively receive (e.g., origination fees). Product-specific rules vary, so use this as a comparison tool."
    },
    {
      q: "Does APR predict the total amount paid?",
      a: "It helps compare cost across offers, but total paid also depends on term, payment schedule, and whether you prepay or refinance."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my APR is extremely high?",
      a: "Very high APRs can make the payment mostly interest early on. Use APR to compare offers, but also review total interest paid and whether fees are avoidable."
    },
    {
      q: "Can APR change over time?",
      a: "For variable-rate products it can. This calculator assumes a fixed payment based on the nominal rate provided."
    },
    {
      q: "Is this an official APR disclosure?",
      a: "No. It’s an educational estimate to compare scenarios. Official APR disclosures follow specific legal rules."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Quick takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR can be higher than the interest rate when there are upfront fees.</li>
      <li>Compare offers using the same term and assumptions.</li>
      <li>If you refinance or prepay early, the lowest-APR offer may not be the cheapest for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      If two loans have the same nominal rate but one has higher upfront fees, the loan with higher fees can have a
      higher APR. Use this page to compare offers on a consistent term and payment schedule.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Step-by-step example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Example: $10,000 loan, 12% interest rate, 24-month term, $300 origination fee. You receive about $9,700 after fees
      but still repay based on the $10,000 balance. The APR is the rate that matches your payment stream to that
      $9,700 net amount.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR is a comparison metric; it does not always match your total interest paid.</li>
      <li>Some fees may be paid out-of-pocket vs financed; your cash-to-close can differ even if APR is similar.</li>
      <li>Official lender APR disclosures can treat fees and timing differently than simplified calculators.</li>
      <li>If you expect to prepay or refinance, APR may not capture the full picture for your situation.</li>
