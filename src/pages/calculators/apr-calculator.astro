    "Monthly payment is calculated from the nominal rate and loan amount using standard amortization.",
    "APR is estimated by solving for the discount rate that makes the present value of payments equal to the net amount received (loan amount minus fees).",

    {
      q: "APR vs interest rate: what’s the difference?",
      a: "Interest rate is the nominal rate used to compute interest. APR includes certain fees and can be higher than the interest rate."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I calculate APR with an origination fee?",
      a: "Treat the origination fee as reducing the amount you effectively receive. APR is the rate that makes the present value of your payments equal to (loan amount − fees)."
    },
    {
      q: "Which fees should I include?",
      a: "Include upfront fees that reduce what you effectively receive (e.g., origination fees). Product-specific rules vary, so use this as a comparison tool."
    },
    {
      q: "Does APR predict the total amount paid?",
      a: "It helps compare cost across offers, but total paid also depends on term, payment schedule, and whether you prepay or refinance."
    },
    {
      q: "Can APR change over time?",
      a: "For variable-rate products it can. This calculator assumes a fixed payment based on the nominal rate provided."
    },
    {
      q: "Is this an official APR disclosure?",
      a: "No. It’s an educational estimate to compare scenarios. Official APR disclosures follow specific legal rules."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Quick takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR can be higher than the interest rate when there are upfront fees.</li>
      <li>Compare offers using the same term and assumptions.</li>
      <li>If you refinance or prepay early, the “best APR” offer may not be the cheapest for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      If two loans have the same nominal rate but one has higher upfront fees, the loan with higher fees can have a
      higher APR. Use this page to compare offers on a consistent term and payment schedule.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Step-by-step example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Example: $10,000 loan, 12% interest rate, 24-month term, $300 origination fee. You receive about $9,700 after fees
      but still repay based on the $10,000 balance. The APR is the rate that matches your payment stream to that
      $9,700 net amount.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR is a comparison metric; it does not always match your total interest paid.</li>
      <li>Some fees may be paid out-of-pocket vs financed — your cash-to-close can differ even if APR is similar.</li>
      <li>Official lender APR disclosures can treat fees and timing differently than simplified calculators.</li>
      <li>If you expect to prepay or refinance, the “best APR” offer may not be the best for your situation.</li>
    </ul>
