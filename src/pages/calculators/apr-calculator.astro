  intro="Use this APR calculator to calculate APR by combining the interest rate with upfront fees, so you can compare loan offers on a more apples-to-apples basis. This is an educational estimate, not an official lender disclosure. Not financial advice."
  how={[
    "Monthly payment is calculated from the nominal rate and loan amount using standard amortization.",
    "APR is estimated by solving for the discount rate that makes the present value of payments equal to the net amount received (loan amount minus fees).",
    "This is a simplified estimate; lender APR disclosures follow specific regulatory rules and may treat fees differently."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "APR vs interest rate: what's the difference?",
      a: "Interest rate is the nominal rate used to compute interest. APR includes certain fees and can be higher than the interest rate."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I find out my APR?",
      a: "For credit cards, your APR is on your statement or cardmember agreement. For loans, lenders disclose APR in the Truth in Lending documents. This calculator estimates APR from rate, term, and upfront fees to compare scenarios."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I calculate APR with an origination fee?",
      a: "Treat the origination fee as reducing the amount you effectively receive. APR is the rate that makes the present value of your payments equal to (loan amount - fees)."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I calculate APR from a monthly payment?",
      a: "Sometimes. If you know the loan amount, term, and fees, the payment can imply an APR. This calculator estimates APR under a simplified schedule; real disclosures can differ."
    },
    {
      q: "Which fees should I include?",
      a: "Include upfront fees that reduce what you effectively receive (e.g., origination fees). Product-specific rules vary, so use this as a comparison tool."
    },
    {
      q: "Does APR predict the total amount paid?",
      a: "It helps compare cost across offers, but total paid also depends on term, payment schedule, and whether you prepay or refinance."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my APR is extremely high?",
      a: "Very high APRs can make the payment mostly interest early on. Use APR to compare offers, but also review total interest paid and whether fees are avoidable."
    },
    {
      q: "Can APR change over time?",
      a: "For variable-rate products it can. This calculator assumes a fixed payment based on the nominal rate provided."
    },
    {
      q: "Is this an official APR disclosure?",
      a: "No. It's an educational estimate to compare scenarios. Official APR disclosures follow specific legal rules."

      <li>APR can be higher than the interest rate when there are upfront fees.</li>
      <li>Compare offers using the same term and assumptions.</li>
      <li>If you refinance or prepay early, the lowest-APR offer may not be the cheapest for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      If two loans have the same nominal rate but one has higher upfront fees, the loan with higher fees can have a
      higher APR. Use this page to compare offers on a consistent term and payment schedule.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Assumptions & limitations</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>This is a simplified fixed-rate estimate using a standard monthly payment schedule.</li>
      <li>We treat fees as reducing the net amount received; lender disclosures can categorize fees differently.</li>
      <li>If you plan to refinance or repay early, compare total cost over your expected time horizon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR is a comparison metric; it does not always match your total interest paid.</li>
      <li>Some fees may be paid out-of-pocket vs financed; your cash-to-close can differ even if APR is similar.</li>
      <li>Official lender APR disclosures can treat fees and timing differently than simplified calculators.</li>
      <li>If you expect to prepay or refinance, APR may not capture the full picture for your situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Match your disclosure</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Compare to the APR in your Loan Estimate or cardmember agreement, not the interest rate line.</li>
      <li>Check whether fees are financed or paid upfront; APR changes based on net amount received.</li>
      <li>Align the term and payment schedule to the disclosure (monthly vs other).</li>
    </ul>
