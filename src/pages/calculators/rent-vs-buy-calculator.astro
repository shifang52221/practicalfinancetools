      a: "Different tools include different costs (taxes, maintenance, opportunity cost, and tax impacts) and use different modeling assumptions."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to interpret results</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Rent vs buy results depend heavily on assumptions. Use this tool to compare scenarios, not to predict the future.
      Small changes in appreciation, rent growth, or mortgage rate can change the break-even horizon.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Taxes, deductions, and after-tax investment returns are not modeled here.</li>
      <li>Maintenance is uncertain; older homes or condos can have large one-time costs.</li>
      <li>Opportunity cost matters: tying up cash in a down payment can reduce investable funds.</li>
      <li>Holding period is critical—selling costs can dominate short time horizons.</li>
    </ul>
