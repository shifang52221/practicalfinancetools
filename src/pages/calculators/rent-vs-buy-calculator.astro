      q: "Does this include taxes or deductions?",
      a: "No. This model is simplified and does not include income taxes, itemized deductions, or tax credits."

      q: "What assumptions matter most?",
      a: "Holding period, mortgage rate, home appreciation, rent growth, selling costs, and investment return often drive results."

    {
      q: "What does break-even mean here?",
      a: "Break-even is the time horizon where your modeled net worth (or total cost) is similar between renting and buying under the assumptions you entered. It is not a prediction, just a scenario result."
    },
    {
      q: "How long do I need to stay for buying to make sense?",
      a: "There is no universal number. Short time horizons can be dominated by closing and selling costs, while longer horizons may benefit from amortization and appreciation. Use the holding period input to test scenarios."

      a: "No. It's an educational scenario comparison, not advice."

      q: "Does this include PMI?",
      a: "Not explicitly. If you pay PMI, you can approximate it by increasing the monthly homeowner costs (or maintenance/other costs) to reflect it."

    {
      q: "Does it include closing and selling costs?",
      a: "Yes, as percentages of home price/value based on your inputs."
    },
    {
      q: "Why might results differ from other calculators?",
      a: "Different tools include different costs (taxes, maintenance, opportunity cost, and tax impacts) and use different modeling assumptions."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to interpret results</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Rent vs buy results depend heavily on assumptions. Use this tool to compare scenarios, not to predict the future.
      Small changes in appreciation, rent growth, or mortgage rate can change the break-even horizon.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Example scenarios to try</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Short horizon (2-4 years): test higher selling costs and modest appreciation.</li>
      <li>Long horizon (7-10+ years): test a conservative appreciation rate and higher maintenance.</li>
      <li>Rate sensitivity: run the same home price with a higher mortgage rate to see how quickly results change.</li>
      <li>Opportunity cost: increase investment return to see the effect of tying up cash in a down payment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to set assumptions</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Appreciation and rent growth: use conservative scenarios, then add an optimistic scenario for comparison.</li>
      <li>Maintenance: plan for ongoing costs and occasional large repairs.</li>
      <li>Selling costs: include agent fees and other costs; these often dominate short holding periods.</li>
      <li>Investment return: use a range; after-tax results may be different.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Sensitivity checks</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Change holding period by +/- 2 years to see break-even shifts.</li>
      <li>Raise the mortgage rate 1% to test payment pressure.</li>
      <li>Lower appreciation and raise rent growth to stress test buying.</li>
      <li>Compare a higher down payment vs investing the difference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to verify</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Use realistic local tax and insurance estimates.</li>
      <li>Match the loan term to what you would actually choose.</li>
      <li>Include expected maintenance for the property type and age.</li>
      <li>Check that selling costs reflect your market.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Cash assumptions to test</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Down payment size changes both loan cost and invested cash.</li>
      <li>Closing costs can be large in the first year; test a higher estimate.</li>
      <li>Renter insurance and utilities are not modeled; include them in your own budget.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Taxes, deductions, and after-tax investment returns are not modeled here.</li>
      <li>Maintenance is uncertain; older homes or condos can have large one-time costs.</li>
      <li>Opportunity cost matters: tying up cash in a down payment can reduce investable funds.</li>
      <li>Holding period is critical; selling costs can dominate short time horizons.</li>
    </ul>
