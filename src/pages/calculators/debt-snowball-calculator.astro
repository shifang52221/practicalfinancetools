    "Each month, interest is estimated as balance × (APR ÷ 12).",
    "Minimum payments are applied to all debts; extra money is applied to the target debt (smallest balance).",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What is the debt snowball method?",
      a: "A payoff strategy that prioritizes the smallest balance first to build momentum while still paying minimums on everything else."
    },
    {
      q: "Is snowball better than avalanche?",
      a: "Snowball can be easier to stick with because you get quick wins. Avalanche often minimizes total interest. The best method is the one you will follow consistently."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this assume fixed APRs and minimum payments?",
      a: "Yes. If APRs change, minimum payment rules change, or you miss payments, results can change."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I include 0% promo balances?",
      a: "Yes—set APR to 0%. Be aware promo periods can end and minimum payment rules vary by issuer."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees or new purchases?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and new purchases are not included, and they can slow payoff."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I miss a payment?",
      a: "This assumes on-time payments. Missed payments and penalty APR can increase costs and payoff time."

    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Enter each debt’s balance, APR, and minimum payment. Then add an “extra payment” amount—the additional money you
      can put toward debt each month. The snowball method applies that extra amount to the smallest balance first to
      help you get early payoffs.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Snowball may not minimize interest; it prioritizes motivation and simplicity over cost.</li>
      <li>APR and minimum payment rules can change (promo APR ends, penalty APR, issuer policy changes).</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases or fees can extend payoff time significantly.</li>
      <li>If your “extra payment” is not realistic, the plan may be hard to stick with—start conservative.</li>
    </ul>
