    "Each month, interest is estimated as balance x (APR / 12).",
    "Minimum payments are applied to all debts; extra money is applied to the target debt (smallest balance).",
    "When a debt is paid off, its payment is freed up for other debts.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What is the debt snowball method?",
      a: "A payoff strategy that prioritizes the smallest balance first to build momentum while still paying minimums on everything else."
    },
    {
      q: "Is snowball better than avalanche?",
      a: "Snowball can be easier to stick with because you get quick wins. Avalanche often minimizes total interest. The best method is the one you will follow consistently."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this assume fixed APRs and minimum payments?",
      a: "Yes. If APRs change, minimum payment rules change, or you miss payments, results can change."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I include 0% promo balances?",
      a: "Yes. Set APR to 0%. Be aware promo periods can end and minimum payment rules vary by issuer."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees or new purchases?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and new purchases are not included, and they can slow payoff."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I miss a payment?",
      a: "This assumes on-time payments. Missed payments and penalty APR can increase costs and payoff time."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I stop using credit cards while paying them off?",
      a: "New purchases can slow payoff and add complexity. Many people find it easier to pause new charges (or use cash/debit) while following a payoff plan."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I close accounts after paying them off?",
      a: "Closing accounts can affect your credit profile and may not be necessary. Consider factors like annual fees, spending habits, and credit utilization, and choose what you can sustain."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to use this page</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Enter each debt's balance, APR, and minimum payment. Then add an "extra payment" amount, the additional money you
      can put toward debt each month. The snowball method applies that extra amount to the smallest balance first to
      help you get early payoffs.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Example scenario</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Suppose you have three debts: (1) $600 at 24% APR with a $25 minimum, (2) $2,500 at 18% with a $70 minimum, and
      (3) $8,000 at 8% with a $160 minimum. If you can pay $150 extra each month, snowball targets the $600 balance
      first. After it's paid off, you roll its payment into the next smallest balance and repeat.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to verify</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Balances are current and include any interest already posted.</li>
      <li>APR and minimum payments match your statement.</li>
      <li>Extra payment amount is realistic for your budget.</li>
      <li>New purchases and fees are excluded from this model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">When snowball can be a fit</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>You want quick wins to stay motivated.</li>
      <li>Small balances can be closed quickly with focused payments.</li>
      <li>You value simplicity over absolute interest minimization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Compare snowball vs avalanche</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Snowball targets the smallest balance first for momentum, while avalanche targets the highest APR to minimize interest.
      Run both plans to see which payoff timeline fits your goals.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to make the plan realistic</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Use the statement minimum payment (or required payment) so the schedule stays realistic.</li>
      <li>Start with an extra payment you can sustain, then increase it when you have proof it works.</li>
      <li>If you have promo APRs that will end, rerun the plan with the future APR as a scenario.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Snowball may not minimize interest; it prioritizes motivation and simplicity over cost.</li>
      <li>APR and minimum payment rules can change (promo APR ends, penalty APR, issuer policy changes).</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases or fees can extend payoff time significantly.</li>
      <li>If your "extra payment" is not realistic, the plan may be hard to stick with; start conservative.</li>
    </ul>
