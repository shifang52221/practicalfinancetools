    {
      q: "How do I calculate credit card payoff?",
      a: "You need your starting balance, APR, and payment amount. This calculator estimates a month-by-month schedule and shows the payoff date and total interest under a fixed APR."
    },
    {
      q: "How is credit card interest calculated?",
      a: "This tool estimates interest monthly using APR/12. Your issuer may use a daily balance method, different compounding, and statement-cycle timing."
    },
    {
      q: "Is this a credit card interest payoff calculator?",
      a: "Yes - it's designed to estimate interest paid and payoff time from your balance, APR, and payment. For statement-accurate results, check your issuer's daily interest method and cycle dates."
    },
    {
      q: "Credit card interest calculator payoff: why can my statement differ?",
      a: "Many issuers use daily interest methods and statement-cycle timing, plus fees and new purchases can change the balance. This page uses a monthly estimate (APR/12) for planning and comparisons."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the minimum payment affect payoff time?",
      a: "A lower payment means more of each payment goes to interest early on, so payoff can take many years. Increasing your payment usually reduces total interest significantly."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my APR changes?",
      a: "Results assume a fixed APR. If your APR changes (promo ends, penalty APR, variable APR), payoff time and interest can change significantly."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include new purchases or balance transfers?",
      a: "No. This assumes you stop adding new charges and fees. Adding purchases can extend payoff time."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and balance transfer fees are not included."
    },
    {
      q: "Why does interest look higher early on?",
      a: "Interest is proportional to your balance. Higher starting balances generate more interest, so early months often show higher interest amounts."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my payment is too low?",
      a: "If a payment is below the interest charged, the balance can grow and payoff may never happen. Increase the payment or reduce the APR to make progress."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Quick takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Small payment increases can meaningfully reduce total interest.</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases can keep the balance from dropping even if you pay every month.</li>
      <li>Real statements often use daily interest; this page is a monthly estimate for planning.</li>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Assumptions & limitations</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>This page estimates interest monthly using APR/12; many issuers use daily interest and statement cycles.</li>
      <li>Assumes you stop adding new purchases and fees; adding purchases can extend payoff time.</li>
      <li>If APR changes mid-stream (promo ends, penalty APR), re-run the numbers with the new rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Issuers often use daily interest and statement cycles; monthly estimates can differ from your statement.</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases can keep the balance from dropping even if you keep paying.</li>
      <li>If your payment is near the interest amount, payoff can take many years.</li>
      <li>Fees (annual, late, transfer) can change total cost; this tool does not include fees.</li>
