      q: "Why can minimum payments take so long?",
      a: "Minimum payments can be a small fraction of your balance, so principal reduction is slow while interest keeps accruing."

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Try a $5,000 balance at 24.99% APR. Compare minimum payments only versus paying an extra $25-$100 per month.
      Many people are surprised by how much time and interest minimum-only payments can add.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to sanity-check</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR: use the rate from your statement (not a promo teaser rate).</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rule: some issuers use % of balance plus interest/fees.</li>
      <li>New purchases: this tool assumes none; new charges can extend payoff.</li>
      <li>Statement timing: real statements may differ due to daily interest and cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to use the results</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Increase the payment until the payoff time feels realistic for your budget.</li>
      <li>Compare total interest under two payments to see the cost of waiting.</li>
      <li>If a balance grows, raise the payment above monthly interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">If payoff takes too long</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Increase the payment by a small fixed amount and re-run the plan.</li>
      <li>Check if a lower APR (transfer or refinance) is realistic for you.</li>
      <li>Focus extra payments on the highest APR balance first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Pick a target payment</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Set a payoff window (for example 24 or 36 months) and back into a payment.</li>
      <li>Use the interest total to weigh tradeoffs between speed and cash flow.</li>
      <li>Re-run every 3-6 months to adjust for balance changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Statement fields to verify</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>APR shown on the statement (not marketing or teaser rate).</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rule and any percentage tiers.</li>
      <li>Whether fees are included in the minimum payment calculation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Match your statement minimum</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Use the statement minimum as a reality check against the calculator output.</li>
      <li>If the statement includes interest and fees in the minimum, raise the percent input to match.</li>
      <li>Re-check after the next statement cycle to confirm the rule you are modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Compare to a fixed-payment plan</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Minimum payment rules change with the balance. If you want a predictable payoff timeline, compare the same balance in the{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/credit-card-payoff-calculator">Credit Card Payoff Calculator</a> using a fixed monthly payment.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Issuers often use daily interest and statement cycles; monthly estimates can differ from your statement.</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rules vary by issuer and can change over time.</li>
      <li>New purchases, late fees, and penalty APR can extend payoff dramatically.</li>
      <li>If you're carrying multiple balances, prioritization (snowball/avalanche) can matter more than minimum rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Reality check vs your statement</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Compare the calculator's minimum payment to your statement minimum.</li>
      <li>If your issuer uses a tiered rule, adjust the percent-of-balance input to match.</li>
      <li>Re-run after your next statement cycle to see how the minimum actually changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to match issuer rules</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Many issuers calculate minimums as a percentage of balance with a dollar floor, but some add interest and fees.
      Use your statement to estimate the implied percentage and update the input so the model stays realistic.
