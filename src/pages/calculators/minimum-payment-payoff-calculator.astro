    "Monthly interest is estimated as balance × (APR ÷ 12).",

    {
      q: "Do issuers calculate minimum payments differently?",
      a: "Yes. Many issuers use tiered rules and include fees/interest differently. This calculator uses a simplified common rule to estimate payoff."
    },
    {
      q: "Why can minimum payments take so long?",
      a: "Minimum payments can be a small fraction of your balance, so principal reduction is slow while interest keeps accruing."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if my minimum is close to interest?",
      a: "Progress can be extremely slow. Increasing your payment even a little can shorten payoff time substantially."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include new purchases?",
      a: "No. This assumes no new charges are added to the balance."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and other fees are not included. Fees can meaningfully increase total cost."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I reduce total interest?",
      a: "Pay more than the minimum, reduce APR (e.g., refinance/transfer), and prioritize higher-APR balances first."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Try a $5,000 balance at 24.99% APR. Compare “minimum payments only” versus paying an extra $25–$100 per month.
      Many people are surprised by how much time and interest minimum-only payments can add.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Issuers often use daily interest and statement cycles; monthly estimates can differ from your statement.</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rules vary by issuer and can change over time.</li>
      <li>New purchases, late fees, and penalty APR can extend payoff dramatically.</li>
      <li>If you’re carrying multiple balances, prioritization (snowball/avalanche) can matter more than minimum rules.</li>
    </ul>
