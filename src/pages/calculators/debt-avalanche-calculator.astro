    "Minimum payments are applied to all debts; extra money is applied to the target debt (highest APR).",

      q: "What is the debt avalanche method?",
      a: "A payoff strategy that prioritizes the highest interest rate first to minimize total interest over time."
    },
    {
      q: "Does avalanche always save more interest?",
      a: "Often yes, but exact results depend on balances, minimums, and rates. If rates are similar, results may be close to snowball."
    },
    {
      q: "What counts as a minimum payment?",
      a: "Whatever amount you must pay monthly to stay current. Use your statement minimum or required payment."

      q: "Can I compare snowball vs avalanche?",
      a: "Yes—run the same debts through both tools to compare total interest and timeline."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees, penalties, or new purchases?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and new purchases are not included, and they can slow payoff."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my APR changes?",
      a: "This assumes fixed APRs. If you have promo APRs or variable APRs, update the inputs and re-run scenarios as they change."

    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Enter each debt’s balance, APR, and minimum payment. Then add an “extra payment” amount—the additional money you
      can put toward debt each month. The avalanche method applies that extra amount to the highest APR first to reduce
      total interest.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Avalanche can feel slower early on because it targets APR, not smallest balance.</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rules vary by issuer and can change over time.</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases or fees can extend payoff time significantly.</li>
      <li>Promo APRs can end—re-run the plan when rates change.</li>
    </ul>
