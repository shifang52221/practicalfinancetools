    "Each month, interest is estimated as balance × (APR ÷ 12).",
    "Minimum payments are applied to all debts; extra money is applied to the target debt (highest APR).",
    "When a debt is paid off, its payment is freed up for other debts.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What is the debt avalanche method?",
      a: "A payoff strategy that prioritizes the highest interest rate first to minimize total interest over time."
    },
    {
      q: "Does avalanche always save more interest?",
      a: "Often yes, but exact results depend on balances, minimums, and rates. If rates are similar, results may be close to snowball."
    },
    {
      q: "What counts as a minimum payment?",
      a: "Whatever amount you must pay monthly to stay current. Use your statement minimum or required payment."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I compare snowball vs avalanche?",
      a: "Yes—run the same debts through both tools to compare total interest and timeline."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include fees, penalties, or new purchases?",
      a: "No. Late fees, annual fees, and new purchases are not included, and they can slow payoff."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my APR changes?",
      a: "This assumes fixed APRs. If you have promo APRs or variable APRs, update the inputs and re-run scenarios as they change."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I pay off the highest APR even if the balance is huge?",
      a: "Avalanche targets APR to reduce interest cost, but it can feel slower if the highest-APR balance is large. If motivation is a concern, compare the timeline to snowball and choose the plan you’ll stick with."
    },
    {
      q: "What if two debts have the same APR?",
      a: "If APRs are equal, many people break ties by paying the smaller balance first (for a quicker payoff) or by paying the higher minimum first. The difference is usually small if APRs are identical."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to use this page</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Enter each debt’s balance, APR, and minimum payment. Then add an “extra payment” amount—the additional money you
      can put toward debt each month. The avalanche method applies that extra amount to the highest APR first to reduce
      total interest.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Example scenario</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Suppose you have three debts: (1) $600 at 24% APR with a $25 minimum, (2) $2,500 at 18% with a $70 minimum, and
      (3) $8,000 at 8% with a $160 minimum. If you can pay $150 extra each month, avalanche targets the 24% APR debt
      first to reduce interest cost. After it’s paid off, you roll its payment into the next highest APR and repeat.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to make the plan realistic</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Use the statement minimum payment (or required payment) so the schedule stays realistic.</li>
      <li>Start with an extra payment you can sustain, then increase it after a few consistent months.</li>
      <li>If promo APRs will end, rerun the plan with the future APR as a scenario.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Avalanche can feel slower early on because it targets APR, not smallest balance.</li>
      <li>Minimum payment rules vary by issuer and can change over time.</li>
      <li>Adding new purchases or fees can extend payoff time significantly.</li>
      <li>Promo APRs can end—re-run the plan when rates change.</li>
    </ul>
