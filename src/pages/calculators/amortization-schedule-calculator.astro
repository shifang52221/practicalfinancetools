    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to read the schedule</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Early payments are interest-heavy because the balance is highest. Over time, interest decreases and more of each
      payment goes toward principal. The "Balance" column shows how much you still owe after each payment.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">When this schedule is most useful</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Checking how much principal is paid in year 1 vs later years.</li>
      <li>Estimating the balance at a future date (for refi or sale planning).</li>
      <li>Comparing two rates or terms under the same loan amount.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to compare two loans</h2>
    <ol class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Run the first loan and note the payment and balance at year 5.</li>
      <li>Change only one input (rate or term), then re-run.</li>
      <li>Compare the total interest and balance at the same time point.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">If your statement differs</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Servicers may use different rounding conventions.</li>
      <li>Payment posting dates can shift interest slightly.</li>
      <li>Escrow changes do not affect this principal-and-interest schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Useful balance checkpoints</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Balance at year 1: early principal reduction snapshot.</li>
      <li>Balance at mid-term: compare refinance or recast scenarios.</li>
      <li>Balance before sale: estimate proceeds after payoff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">What the interest column reveals</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Faster principal reduction shows up as a quicker drop in monthly interest.</li>
      <li>Higher rates keep interest elevated for longer, even with the same payment.</li>
      <li>Comparing two schedules side by side shows where total interest diverges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Refinance snapshot</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      If you are considering a refinance, compare the balance at the expected refi month. Use that balance as the starting point in the
      refinance scenario so the comparison stays consistent.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">If you plan to pay off early</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      This schedule assumes the standard payment. If you make extra payments or lump sums, use the extra payment calculator to model a
      new schedule and compare the payoff date and interest saved.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to verify</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Loan amount is principal only (exclude taxes, insurance, and fees).</li>
      <li>Interest rate is the note rate, not APR.</li>
      <li>Term matches your loan (15, 20, 30 years, or custom).</li>
      <li>If you plan extra payments, use the extra payment calculator to compare.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Escrow items (taxes/insurance) are not part of amortization; this schedule is principal and interest only.</li>
      <li>Lenders may round payments and interest slightly differently than a calculator.</li>
      <li>Extra payments can change the schedule; use the extra payment calculator for those scenarios.</li>
      <li>Adjustable-rate loans require a rate-change model; this assumes a fixed rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Match your statement</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Check the payment posting date; interest can shift if your servicer posts earlier or later.</li>
      <li>Compare one or two rows in the schedule to your statement to validate rounding.</li>
      <li>If the statement shows escrow, compare only principal and interest amounts.</li>
    </ul>
