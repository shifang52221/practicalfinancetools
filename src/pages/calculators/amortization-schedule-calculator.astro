    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">How to read the schedule</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Early payments are interest-heavy because the balance is highest. Over time, interest decreases and more of each
      payment goes toward principal. The “Balance” column shows how much you still owe after each payment.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Escrow items (taxes/insurance) are not part of amortization—this schedule is principal and interest only.</li>
      <li>Lenders may round payments and interest slightly differently than a calculator.</li>
      <li>Extra payments can change the schedule; use the extra payment calculator for those scenarios.</li>
      <li>Adjustable-rate loans require a rate-change model; this assumes a fixed rate.</li>
    </ul>
