  intro="Estimate the impact of biweekly mortgage payments using a common approximation (13 payments per year). Compare payoff time and interest savings under consistent assumptions. Educational use only. Not financial advice."
  how={[
    "First we compute the baseline monthly principal-and-interest (P&I) payment using standard amortization.",
    "Biweekly payments are approximated as an additional principal amount equal to (monthly P&I ÷ 12) each month (the common 13-payments-per-year rule).",
    "This is an estimate; real results vary based on posting dates, rounding, and whether the lender truly applies payments every two weeks."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this a biweekly mortgage payment calculator?",
      a: "Yes. It estimates the payoff impact using the common 13-payments-per-year approximation, which is often close for planning."
    },
    {
      q: "Does biweekly always save more than paying extra principal monthly?",
      a: "Not always. If your lender holds biweekly payments and posts them monthly, savings can be similar to making a small monthly extra. Earlier posting tends to save more interest."
    },
    {
      q: "How much is a biweekly mortgage payment?",
      a: "A common approach is to take the monthly principal-and-interest (P&I) payment and divide by 2. Note: escrow items (tax/insurance) are separate."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my lender charges a fee for a biweekly program?",
      a: "Fees can reduce or eliminate the benefit. Compare interest saved to fees, and consider doing a no-fee monthly extra instead."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I model one extra payment per year instead?",
      a: "Yes. The 13-payments-per-year effect is often similar to adding about (monthly payment ÷ 12) as a monthly extra, or making one extra principal payment per year."
