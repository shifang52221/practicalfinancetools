  intro="Estimate the impact of biweekly mortgage payments using a common approximation (13 payments per year). Compare payoff time and interest savings under consistent assumptions. Educational use only. Not financial advice."
  how={[
    "First we compute the baseline monthly principal-and-interest (P&I) payment using standard amortization.",
    "Biweekly payments are approximated as an additional principal amount equal to (monthly P&I / 12) each month (the common 13-payments-per-year rule).",
    "This is an estimate; real results vary based on posting dates, rounding, and whether the lender truly applies payments every two weeks."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this a biweekly mortgage payment calculator?",
      a: "Yes. It estimates the payoff impact using the common 13-payments-per-year approximation, which is often close for planning."
    },
    {
      q: "Does biweekly always save more than paying extra principal monthly?",
      a: "Not always. If your lender holds biweekly payments and posts them monthly, savings can be similar to making a small monthly extra. Earlier posting tends to save more interest."
    },
    {
      q: "How much is a biweekly mortgage payment?",
      a: "A common approach is to take the monthly principal-and-interest (P&I) payment and divide by 2. Note: escrow items (tax/insurance) are separate."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my lender charges a fee for a biweekly program?",
      a: "Fees can reduce or eliminate the benefit. Compare interest saved to fees, and consider doing a no-fee monthly extra instead."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I model one extra payment per year instead?",
      a: "Yes. The 13-payments-per-year effect is often similar to adding about (monthly payment / 12) as a monthly extra, or making one extra principal payment per year."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between true biweekly and accelerated biweekly?",
      a: "True biweekly is usually half the monthly principal-and-interest (P&I) payment every two weeks, which results in 26 half payments (13 full payments) per year. Some programs market \"biweekly\" but actually hold your payments and post them monthly."
    },
    {
      q: "Does biweekly change escrow (taxes and insurance)?",
      a: "Escrow amounts are set by your servicer and can change over time. This calculator focuses on principal and interest. If you pay escrow with your mortgage, make sure your payment method covers escrow correctly."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Quick takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>True biweekly payments create 13 full payments per year (26 half payments).</li>
      <li>If payments are held and posted monthly, savings can be smaller than expected.</li>
      <li>Compare biweekly to a simple monthly extra to avoid fee-based programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to confirm</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Check whether payments are posted every two weeks or held until month-end.</li>
      <li>If a program fee exists, compare total fees to estimated interest saved.</li>
      <li>Confirm extra amounts are applied to principal, not future due dates.</li>
      <li>If escrow is paid with your mortgage, verify the servicer's biweekly rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to compare options</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Start with your baseline P&I payment and interest rate.</li>
      <li>If there's a biweekly program fee, compare total fees to expected interest saved.</li>
      <li>If your lender posts biweekly payments monthly, compare to a simple monthly extra instead.</li>
      <li>Confirm extra amounts are applied to principal (not just "paid ahead").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Some "biweekly" services are third parties that charge fees and don't speed up posting.</li>
      <li>If payments are held until month-end, savings can be smaller than true biweekly posting.</li>
      <li>Escrow changes can affect the cash flow even if principal-and-interest stays the same.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">When biweekly may not help</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>If the lender posts payments monthly, results can be close to a small monthly extra instead.</li>
      <li>If the program fee is high, interest savings may be fully offset.</li>
      <li>If cash flow is irregular, a monthly extra or occasional lump sum can be easier to sustain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to verify your program</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Ask whether payments post every two weeks or only at month-end.</li>
      <li>Confirm how escrow is handled (some programs require a separate escrow schedule).</li>
      <li>Check whether a third party charges a setup or monthly fee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How to sanity-check the savings</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Compare biweekly results to a monthly extra equal to (payment / 12).</li>
      <li>Check the payoff date difference and total interest saved, not just monthly payment size.</li>
      <li>Re-run with a slightly different rate to see how sensitive results are.</li>
    </ul>
