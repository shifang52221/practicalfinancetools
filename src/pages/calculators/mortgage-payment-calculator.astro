    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Example inputs: $450,000 home price, $90,000 down payment, 6.50% APR, 30-year term, $5,400/yr property taxes,
      $1,800/yr insurance, $0 HOA, and 0.60% PMI rate. Use this to sanity-check what you can afford and compare
      scenarios (rate, down payment, taxes, and insurance).
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Inputs to double-check</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Taxes and insurance are annual figures; confirm the local numbers.</li>
      <li>PMI rate depends on credit score and loan type; use a conservative estimate.</li>
      <li>HOA dues vary by property; include them if applicable.</li>
      <li>Down payment affects PMI and loan size; test 5%, 10%, 20% scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">How lenders use this number</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Combine PITI + HOA + PMI for housing payment in DTI checks.</li>
      <li>Stress tests may use higher rates or taxes than your initial estimate.</li>
      <li>Escrow rules can change cash-to-close and early monthly payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Payment levers to test</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Down payment: higher down payment lowers principal and may remove PMI.</li>
      <li>Rate: compare offers 0.25%-0.50% apart for monthly impact.</li>
      <li>Term: 15-year vs 30-year tradeoff between payment and total interest.</li>
      <li>Taxes/insurance: local estimates can move the total more than rate changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">DTI and affordability checks</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Use the total housing payment (PITI + HOA + PMI) in your DTI estimate.</li>
      <li>Test a higher tax or insurance estimate to reduce surprise increases.</li>
      <li>Compare a 15-year vs 30-year term to see the cash flow tradeoff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Cash-to-close vs monthly cost</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Lowering the rate with points can reduce the payment but increase upfront cash. Compare the monthly savings to the points cost and
      your expected time in the home.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Taxes and insurance are annual numbers here; the calculator converts them to monthly.</li>
      <li>PMI is a simplified estimate and can differ by loan program, credit score, and lender policy.</li>
      <li>Escrow rules vary; lenders may require reserves that affect cash-to-close and early payments.</li>
      <li>If you have an adjustable-rate loan (ARM), payments can change; this page assumes fixed-rate payments.</li>
    </ul>
