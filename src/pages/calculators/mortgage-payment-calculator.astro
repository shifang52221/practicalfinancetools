    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Example</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Example inputs: $450,000 home price, $90,000 down payment, 6.50% APR, 30-year term, $5,400/yr property taxes,
      $1,800/yr insurance, $0 HOA, and 0.60% PMI rate. Use this to sanity-check what you can afford and compare
      scenarios (rate, down payment, taxes, and insurance).

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Taxes and insurance are annual numbers here; the calculator converts them to monthly.</li>
      <li>PMI is a simplified estimate and can differ by loan program, credit score, and lender policy.</li>
      <li>Escrow rules vary; lenders may require reserves that affect cash-to-close and early payments.</li>
      <li>If you have an adjustable-rate loan (ARM), payments can change; this page assumes fixed-rate payments.</li>
    </ul>
