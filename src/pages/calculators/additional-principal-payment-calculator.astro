      q: "Additional principal payment mortgage calculator: what does it do?",
      a: "It estimates how paying extra principal (monthly or one-time) can shorten payoff time and reduce total interest compared to a baseline schedule."
    },
    {
      q: "Does additional principal lower my required monthly payment?",
      a: "Usually no. Extra principal tends to shorten the term. Your required payment typically changes only if you recast the loan."
    },
    {
      q: "Monthly extra vs lump sum: which saves more?",
      a: "Earlier principal reduction often saves more interest. A smaller monthly extra can beat a larger lump sum that happens later."
    },
    {
      q: "What is \"paid ahead\" and why does it matter?",
      a: "Some servicers treat extra payments as covering future due dates instead of reducing principal as much as you expect. Confirm your extra is applied as principal-only."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include taxes and insurance (escrow)?",
      a: "No. This focuses on principal and interest. Escrow items are separate and typically do not change when you pay extra principal."

      Try $360,000 at 6.50% for 30 years, then compare: (1) $100-$300 extra per month, and (2) a one-time principal payment (e.g., from a
      bonus) early in the loan. Keep the baseline constant when you compare scenarios.
