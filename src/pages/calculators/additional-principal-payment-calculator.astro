  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Extra principal payment calculator: what does it do?",
      a: "It estimates how paying extra principal (monthly or one-time) can shorten payoff time and reduce total interest compared to a baseline schedule."
    },
    {
      q: "Does additional principal lower my required monthly payment?",
      a: "Usually no. Extra principal tends to shorten the term. Your required payment typically changes only if you recast the loan."
    },
    {
      q: "Monthly extra vs lump sum: which saves more?",
      a: "Earlier principal reduction often saves more interest. A smaller monthly extra can beat a larger lump sum that happens later."
    },
    {
      q: "What is \"paid ahead\" and why does it matter?",
      a: "Some servicers treat extra payments as covering future due dates instead of reducing principal as much as you expect. Confirm your extra is applied as principal-only."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include taxes and insurance (escrow)?",
      a: "No. This focuses on principal and interest. Escrow items are separate and typically do not change when you pay extra principal."
    },
    {
      q: "What is a mortgage recast?",
      a: "A recast is when the servicer re-amortizes your remaining balance (often after a lump-sum principal payment) to reduce the required monthly payment while keeping the same interest rate and maturity date. Not all loans allow it and fees may apply."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I worry about prepayment penalties?",
      a: "Some loans have prepayment penalties or restrictions. This calculator assumes no prepayment penalty. Check your note or ask your servicer before making extra principal payments."

    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      Try $360,000 at 6.50% for 30 years, then compare: (1) $100-$300 extra per month, and (2) a one-time principal payment (e.g., from a
      bonus) early in the loan. Keep the baseline constant when you compare scenarios.

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Quick checklist (principal-only)</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Confirm the payment is applied to principal, not future due dates ("paid ahead").</li>
      <li>Check for prepayment penalties and whether your loan allows principal-only payments.</li>
      <li>Keep your regular payment unchanged when comparing scenarios.</li>
      <li>If you want a lower required payment, look into a recast (if available) instead of expecting extra payments to reduce the bill.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:18px 0 10px">Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Escrow (taxes/insurance) typically does not change when you pay extra principal.</li>
      <li>Servicer posting rules can affect results; verify how extra payments are applied.</li>
      <li>Paying extra principal can reduce liquidity; keep an emergency fund in mind.</li>
