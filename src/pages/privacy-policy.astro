    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Summary</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This site provides finance calculators and related educational content. We do not require account creation. Most
      calculator inputs are processed in your browser to display results. We may use cookies for essential site
      functionality and, if enabled, for advertising and analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We may collect the following categories of information:
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:8px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Basic technical data (e.g., IP address, user agent, approximate location, and timestamps) in server logs.</li>
      <li>Cookie and device identifiers used for site functionality, measurement, and advertising (if enabled).</li>
      <li>Contact information you provide if you email us (your email address and message).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Calculator inputs</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Calculator inputs are intended to be processed locally in your browser to compute and display results. Do not
      enter sensitive personal information you do not want stored on your device or shared with others who use your
      browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies, advertising, and analytics</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We may display ads served by third parties (e.g., Google) and may use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics).
      These services can use cookies and similar technologies to measure performance and, depending on your settings and
      region, to personalize ads or analytics. You can review and change your preferences in our Cookie Notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      You can accept or decline ad personalization in the cookie consent banner or in our Cookie Notice. You can also
      clear your browser storage and cookies to reset your preference.
    </p>

    <h2>CCPA/CPRA (California): "sale" or "sharing"</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We do not sell personal information for money in the traditional sense. However, some advertising technology may
      be considered a "sale" or "sharing" under certain privacy laws. Where applicable, you can opt out by declining
      optional cookies in our Cookie Notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Privacy Control (GPC)</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      If your browser sends a Global Privacy Control signal, we treat it as an opt-out preference for certain advertising uses
      and aim to request non-personalized ads by default.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy requests</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      You can contact us at <a href={`mailto:${SITE.email}`}>{SITE.email}</a> to request access, deletion, or correction of personal
      information we may have (for example, emails you sent us). We may need to verify your request before responding.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      For California residents, you can also use the "Do Not Sell/Share" link in the footer to opt out of certain advertising uses.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We retain server logs for a limited period as needed for security, debugging, and operational purposes. Emails
      are retained as long as needed to respond and maintain records.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date reflects the latest changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Google ad controls</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      You can manage ad personalization at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p class="muted">
