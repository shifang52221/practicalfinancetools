  <section class="card section prose">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">1) Educational use only (no advice)</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The calculators and content on this site are provided for informational and educational purposes only. They are
      not financial, legal, tax, or accounting advice, and do not create any professional relationship. If you need
      advice, consult a qualified professional.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      We are not a bank, lender, broker, investment adviser, or tax preparer. Using this site does not create a fiduciary
      relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Estimates and assumptions</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Results are estimates based on the inputs you provide and the assumptions described on each page. Actual lender
      quotes, statements, and disclosures may differ due to rounding, fees, escrow timing, underwriting, compounding,
      policy rules, and other factors.
    </p>

    <h2>3) No warranty</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We provide the site and calculators "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or
      implied, including accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential,
      special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from your use of the site or reliance on any results.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Third-party services and links</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The site may include links to third-party websites and may display third-party advertising. We do not control
      third parties and are not responsible for their content, products, services, or practices.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Your responsibilities</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      You are responsible for verifying any results before making decisions, and for complying with any applicable
      laws and policies when using the site.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Changes</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      We may update these Terms from time to time. By continuing to use the site after changes are posted, you agree to
      the updated Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>8) Acceptable use</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      You agree not to misuse the site, interfere with its operation, or attempt to access non-public areas. Automated
      scraping or excessive requests that degrade performance are not allowed.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Site content, calculators, and design are owned by Practical Finance Tools or its licensors. You may use the

    </p>

    <h2>10) Availability</h2>

      features at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Security and data</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Do not submit sensitive personal information in free-text fields. While we use reasonable safeguards, no system is
